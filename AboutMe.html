        <p>I love To play Video Games like minecraft.</p>
        <p>But what i really love is coding, i code for a while now in alot of different languages.<br>but currently i am maining:<br><br>Html Css Js (webdev)<br>Skript</p>

    <div class="Childhood">
        <p>Ever since i was young i loved technology: phones, pcs, etc.</p>
        <p>After ive got my computer i found out a passion for gaming and still to this day love gaming</p>
        <p>But ive then i found out about coding, being able to make programs, games, sites, and addons for games And i got really excited.</p>
        <p>i learned some python but then moved on to another simpler coding language to help me learn the "basics and mindset" of coding called "Skript". </p>
        <p>Skript was a real game changer for me, since it helps me learn to code with simple syntax but it helped me learn to modify my favourite game "Minecraft".</p>
        <p>After skript i started Java and after learning Java I moved To Spigot in hope of making real plugins but that fell off after i went to hospital for 2 weeks, RIP.</p>
        <p>Then i learnt arduino from an irl course i was in, where as of making this site i am still in.</p>
        <p>And then i Started HTML & CSS and thats where I am today, i am currently learning javascript aswell and trying to learn Back - End Web Development.</p>
